# Shoppy App Development Summary

## Project Overview
Shoppy is a Progressive Web App (PWA) for managing shopping lists with a modern UI, multiple list support, and offline functionality. The app allows users to create and manage multiple shopping lists, add items with visual icons, and mark items as completed.

## Key Features Implemented

- Implemented a ListManager component for easy list management
- Added ability to set a default list
- Created a "Create Your First List" button for new users

### 3. Visual Icons System
- Created SVG icons for common grocery and household items
- Implemented a dynamic icon generation system for items without predefined icons
- Each item gets a unique, consistent icon based on its name
- Added visual indicators for completed items

### 4. Improved User Experience
- Enhanced modal animations and styling
- Added a floating action button for adding new items
- Implemented a "Recently Used" section for quick access to common items
- Improved visual feedback for user interactions

### 5. Data Persistence
- Used IndexedDB for local data storage
- Implemented CRUD operations for shopping lists and items
- Added support for storing user preferences
